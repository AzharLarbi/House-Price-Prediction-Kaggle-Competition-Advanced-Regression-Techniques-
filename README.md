# House-Price-Prediction-Advanced-Regression-Techniques-

This project aims to predict housing prices using advanced regression techniques, as part of a Kaggle competition. Utilizing multiple regression models and advanced feature engineering, the objective is to develop a model that accurately estimates the price of homes based on a range of numeric and categorical features.

# Project Overview

* Objective: To predict the sale prices of houses using advanced regression techniques.

* Data Source: The dataset is sourced from [[a Kaggle competition House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques]

* Main Models Used: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

* Evaluation Metric: The primary evaluation metric is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the log of SalePrice.

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes training and test sets:

* Training Set: 1,460 entries with 80 features describing various characteristics of residential homes.

* Test Set: 1,459 entries, with the same features as the training set except the target variable, SalePrice.

* Submission Format: The sample submission file contains two columns (Id and SalePrice), and submissions are made with predictions on the test set.

# Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Preparation:

  * Load and inspect the training and test datasets.
  
  * Analyze data types and handle missing values by imputing numeric columns with the mean and categorical columns with "unknown".

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   * Summary statistics, distribution plots, and correlation analysis to understand key drivers of sale price.

   * Scatter plots to visualize the relationship between target and top correlated features (OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars).

3. Modeling:

  * Simple Regression Models: Start with Linear Regression as a baseline.
  
  * Advanced Models:
  
    * Ridge and Lasso for regularized linear regression to handle multicollinearity.
    
    * Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for tree-based ensemble approaches.
    
    * XGBoost for advanced gradient boosting, with hyperparameter tuning.
  
  * Evaluation:
  
    * Models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RMSE on the training data.
  
    * Cross-validation to measure model consistency.

4. Feature Engineering and Encoding:

  * Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoding.
  
  * Scale numeric features to a standard range using MinMaxScaler.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation:

  * Utilize grid search and cross-validation with XGBoost to optimize key parameters (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate) and evaluate stability.
  
  * Track RMSE on validation folds to gauge model generalization.

6. Final Model and Predictions:

  * Identify the best model (Gradient Boosting) based on validation RMSE and leaderboard performance.

  * Generate predictions on the test set and submit the results.

# Results

* Best Model: The Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest accuracy, placing the solution in the top 30% of the Kaggle leaderboard.

* Final Submission: The best model achieved an RMSE score of 0.13341 on the leaderboard.

# Business Insights 

Here are some key business insights we can conclude from this advanced house price prediction project:

1. Top Price Drivers

    * Quality of Construction: The OverallQual feature, which assesses overall material and finish quality, has the highest correlation with sale price. Investing in high-quality materials and finishes can significantly boost a property’s market value.

    * Living Area: Larger living spaces (GrLivArea) are associated with higher prices. Real estate developers might prioritize designs with larger and more open living areas to attract buyers and justify premium pricing.

   * Garage Capacity: More garage space (measured by GarageCars and GarageArea) correlates with higher sale prices. Offering larger or multiple garages could appeal to buyers and drive up property value, particularly in areas where automobile ownership is high.

3. Strategic Investment in Features

    * Targeted Upgrades for Optimal ROI: Upgrades to key areas like living space, garage capacity, and overall quality yield better returns than minor renovations. For instance, boosting square footage and garage space may attract higher-paying buyers, as these features directly impact sale price.

   * Avoiding Over-Improvement: There is diminishing value with excessive improvements in certain areas. For example, a four-car garage has a weaker correlation with increased price than a two- or three-car garage. Builders should avoid excessive upgrades that buyers may not value in proportion to the costs.

5. Impact of Location and Neighborhood

    * Neighborhood-Specific Pricing Insights: Certain neighborhoods drive higher prices regardless of home size or quality. Builders and investors should consider neighborhood-specific factors when pricing homes, as this will optimize the value against the local real estate market.

   * Customizing Features by Neighborhood: Features that are less significant in one area (e.g., garage space in urban settings) might be major selling points in another. Real estate investors can tailor property enhancements based on neighborhood-specific demand, ensuring investments align with buyer expectations in each location.

7. Price Optimization for Sales

    * Enhanced Pricing Models for Real Estate Agencies: By employing advanced regression techniques (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), real estate agencies can build more accurate pricing models. These can guide listing prices to optimize sales outcomes, reduce time on the market, and meet buyer expectations.

   * Dynamic Pricing Based on Market Trends: Advanced models can help adjust prices dynamically, taking into account changing market trends, seasonal patterns, and feature preferences. This approach aligns pricing with market conditions, enhancing competitiveness and increasing the likelihood of quick sales.

9. Market Segmentation Insights

    * Identifying High-Value Customer Segments: The model highlights features associated with higher home prices, helping real estate firms target premium customer segments effectively. For example, targeting buyers who prioritize garage space, large living areas, or premium construction can maximize returns.

   * Pricing Strategies for Different Market Segments: Builders can use the model’s insights to create tiered pricing strategies, where homes with premium features are marketed to high-end buyers, while budget-friendly models prioritize affordability without excessive upgrades.

11. Reducing Risk of Overfitting in Pricing Models

    * Model Selection and Cross-Validation for Accurate Pricing: The iterative model testing, especially with techniques like K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, helped optimize accuracy and reduce overfitting. Real estate firms applying similar methods will improve their pricing model reliability, which reduces the risk of pricing errors that could lead to underpricing or overpricing properties.
